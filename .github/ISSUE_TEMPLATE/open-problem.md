## Creating the open problem statement

The purpose of the open problem statement is twofold.  Firstly, it should convince the reader that the problem you are presenting is worth working on.  Secondly, it should provide enough background and understanding of the problem that all design decisions and requirements are comprehensively described and motivated.  Feel free to deviate from the following template if you prefer, or answer the following questions as succinctly as possible for an easy open problem statement.

While this template was made to support the RFP program, the open problem statements themselves are purely for the benefit of the community, and there is no obligation to make or request an RFP for each open problem.

## (Open Problem Title)
- What is the problem?
- (What are some solved problems that are as important as this one?) (optional)
- (What are related technologies?) (optional)
- Why is this problem important?  What could you do with a solution?
- How do people try to solve this problem? (What are naive solutions?)
- What are the limitations on those solutions?
- What hard constraints should it obey?
- Are there additional soft constraints that a solution would ideally obey?
- Any relevant notes?

I suggest posting open problems as issues in the research repos of the protocol, ipfs, libp2p, and ipld orgs, and respond to the issue with any directions that you might have.  Lastly, please update the index in this research repo's readme.
